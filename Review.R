# OPER 528 Class Review - Last Day of Class!!
# 5/2/22

# UNIT 1: PROBABILITY/STATISTICS
# statistics, common distributions, sample mean/variance (estimate population statistics)
# Law of Large Numbers: Follows a normal distribution if sample size is large enough -
# Central Limit Theorem: Using population variance to build confidence interval; if population variance is unknown, use T score 
# Histrogram: compare to density cures of common probabilty distrivutiosn 
# Note taht some distirbinos (poisson) only allow for integers and postiive only (would not be normal)

# UNIT 2: SIMULATION
# is a numerical study (study behaivor of a system numerically)
# UNIT 3: queing modeks: arrival process, service process, and q discipline (EX. first come first serve)
# steady state analysis: after a long time, the state of the queue does not dependon the queue or time lapsed (arrival rate < steady state MM1)
# roations specify 
# long run behaviors of a queue 

# Simulation: 
# (1) data -> access independence -> guess distribution -> check distribution w hypohtesis testing
# (2) Test 
# (3) Model 
# (4) Simulation -> generate random samples based on the model decided
# (5) Decision 0> ex. 

- monte carlo: monte carlo simulation (use random variate generation) -> be sure about (1) objective function being optimized (max revenue/profit, min cost), control/action/policy, random factor, constraints 
- inverse transofrmation 
- acceptance - rejection 
- convolution 
- integration: shooting method and mean value method
